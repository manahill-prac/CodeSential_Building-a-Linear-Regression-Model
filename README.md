# Linear Regression: Predicting Boston House Prices

### **Objective**
Build a simple **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices (`MEDV`) using one or two features (`RM` and `LSTAT`) from the **Boston Housing Dataset**. Visualize results using **matplotlib**.

### **Dataset**
- Source: [Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altavish/boston-housing-dataset)
- Stored in Google Drive and loaded directly using file ID.
- 506 rows, 14 columns
- Features used: `RM`, `LSTAT`
- Target: `MEDV`

### **Workflow**
1. Load dataset from Google Drive
2. Handle missing values (imputation)
3. Feature selection (`RM`, `LSTAT`)
4. Split dataset into train and test sets
5. Train Linear Regression model
6. Evaluate model (MSE, RÂ²)
7. Visualize predictions vs actual
8. Display feature coefficients
9. Scatter plots for features vs target



### **How to Run**
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
````

2. Open the notebook in **Jupyter** or **Colab**.
3. Execute all cells sequentially.




I can also **create downloadable files** for both `requirements.txt` and `README.md` if you want. Do you want me to do that?
